Font asset "MaterialIcons-Regular.otf" was tree-shaken, reducing it from 1645184 to 1868 bytes (99.9% reduction). Tree-shaking can be disabled by providing the --no-tree-shake-icons flag when building your app.
Target aot_android_asset_bundle failed: 
IconTreeShakerException: Font subsetting failed 
with exit code -1.

To disable icon tree shaking, pass 
--no-tree-shake-icons to the requested flutter 
build command

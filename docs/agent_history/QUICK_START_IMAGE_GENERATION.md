# 🚀 Quick Start Guide - Test Image Generation

## ✅ Everything is Ready!

The app is already configured with the **exact same working methods** that were tested:
- **Stable Horde**: HTTP API (tested ✅)
- **Hugging Face**: Official SDK (tested ✅)

## 📝 Steps to Test:

### 1. Start the Servers

**Terminal 1 - Backend:**
```bash
cd e:\vocab_web\server
python manage.py runserver
```

**Terminal 2 - Frontend:**
```bash
cd e:\vocab_web\client
npm run dev
```

### 2. Add Your API Keys

1. Open browser: `http://localhost:5173`
2. Go to **Settings** page
3. Scroll to **"Image Generation Configuration"**
4. Enter your keys:
   - **Stable Horde API Key**: `<YOUR_STABLE_HORDE_KEY>`
   - **Hugging Face API Token**: `<YOUR_HUGGING_FACE_TOKEN>`
5. Click **"Save Image Keys"**
6. You should see "Settings saved successfully!"

### 3. Generate Your First Illustrated Story

1. Go to **AI Content Generator**
2. Click **"Story"** card
3. **IMPORTANT**: Toggle **"Illustrated Story"** to **ON**
4. Fill in:
   - **Topic**: "A visit to the library"
   - **Level**: "Intermediate"
   - **Target Vocabulary**: (optional)
5. Click **"Generate Content"**

### 4. Watch the Magic! ✨

**What happens:**
1. **~1 minute**: Story text appears
2. **Redirected to Story Viewer**
3. **Images start generating**:
   - You'll see "Waiting for artist..." placeholders
   - Then "Painting scene..." as each generates
   - Images appear one by one with smooth animations
4. **~10-15 minutes**: All 6-8 images complete

**You can read the story while images load!**

## 🔍 How to Monitor Progress

### Check Backend Logs:
```bash
# In the terminal running Django server, you'll see:
INFO - Attempting generation with StableHordeProvider...
INFO - Trying Hugging Face model: black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev
INFO - Successfully generated image with FLUX.1-dev
```

### Check Frontend:
- Open browser DevTools (F12)
- Go to Console tab
- You'll see polling requests every 5 seconds
- Status updates as images complete

## 🎨 Expected Results

Each story event will have a beautiful professional illustration:
- **Style**: Digital illustration (not photorealistic)
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 (widescreen)
- **Quality**: High-detail, professional
- **Consistency**: Same character across all scenes

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If images don't generate:

1. **Check API keys are saved**:
   - Go back to Settings
   - Keys should be there (they're write-only, so you won't see them)
   - Try saving again

2. **Check backend logs**:
   ```bash
   # Look for errors like:
   ERROR - Stable Horde error: ...
   WARNING - Hugging Face model failed: ...
   ```

3. **Check browser console**:
   - Any red errors?
   - Is polling happening? (requests every 5s)

4. **Try generating a new story**:
   - Don't retry old stories
   - Generate a fresh one with images enabled

### If it says "No providers configured":
- Your API keys weren't saved properly
- Go to Settings and save them again
- Make sure you clicked "Save Image Keys" button

## ✅ Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when you see:
- ✅ Story text appears quickly
- ✅ Image placeholders show "Waiting for artist..."
- ✅ Status changes to "Painting scene..."
- ✅ Images appear one by one
- ✅ Provider name shown (e.g., "Generated by Stable Horde")

## 🎯 What to Expect

**First Image**: 1-3 minutes (Stable Horde queue)
**Subsequent Images**: 1-2 minutes each
**Total Time**: 10-20 minutes for full story
**Fallback**: If Stable Horde is slow, Hugging Face kicks in (faster!)
